# üì¶ Python Venn Diagram Generator


## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

I need & have struggled to find a good Venn diagram generator online, thus I have written these scripts to generate them.

The Non-Compute version does NOT do any calculations- it is solely for visualising data you have calculated.

The Compute version (when it's complete) DOES do the calculations.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

Python is needed to run the script. You can find it here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Along with Python, you will also need Tkinter and Matplotlib.

Tkinter usually comes installed with Python, but to make sure both of these dependencies are installed, you can run the following prompts in the command line:
```
python -m tkinter
```
and
```
pip install matplotlib
```
